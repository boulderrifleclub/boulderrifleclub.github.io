# Introduction

## Purpose

As a Member-owned and Member-operated club, it is vital that all members have a complete knowledge and
understanding of the Boulder Rifle Club Range Rules. The purpose of this manual is to inform members of the Range
Rules, and to act as a reference for members and range officers when they are confronted with a new or different
situation on any of our ranges.

## Safety and the range rules

**The most important duty of any member is to keep the range safe**. The member does this by knowing, following,
and helping to enforce the Boulder Rifle Club range rules. If you are uncertain whether an activity or situation
complies with the Range Rules, ask any Board member for clarification. Please err on the side of caution and
safety.

## Exceptions to the range rules

The following Range Rules are in effect at all times, on all Boulder Rifle Club ranges for all users. Any
exceptions to the range rules must be explained and justified in advance and approved by the Board of Directors.

Violators of the rules may be required to appear before the Board of Directors.
Suspension of range privileges or loss of membership may occur if any of the following rules are violated by a
member or their guests. Members who have been suspended must attend a range rules class before being reinstated.

# General range rules

## Member responsibilities

### Protect our club

Members shall have a current, valid membership card on their person and have a liability release form on file
when on any BRC property.

Do not share a numbered key or reveal any BRC lock combination with any non-member.

Lock the gate behind you. At the South Range during scheduled activities involving non-members, the gate
shall be left in the condition in which you found it; during events, the gate may be closed with the chain
attached with a mariner’s clip, with the padlock secured to the eye-bolt on the gate post.

**Always** lock the North Range gate after entering and upon leaving.

Only BRC Members who have attended a Range Rules Class and possess a current BRC Membership card shall open
any BRC locks.

No individuals under the influence of alcohol, medications or other substances which impair vision, balance,
or judgment are allowed on the range. Nor are such items to be consumed on the property. Possession of drugs,
including alcohol, is not allowed on BRC property. This is in addition to prohibitions of use or being under
the influence of any impairing substance.

Every individual present on the range is responsible for safety. If a Range Officer is present, the RO has
the final authority and control over all activities on the range.

It is the duty of any member to ask anyone who acts in an unsafe manner to cease their unsafe actions and/or
leave the range.

### Guest policies

The ranges are open to non-members only when accompanied by a BRC Member or under the control of a Range
Officer (RO) on that range.

Members have the right to bring guests when the range is not open to the public. During times when the South
Range is open to the public, guests must pay the range fee.

Guests must be under the host BRC Member’s **direct** supervision **at all times** if the range is closed to
the public, otherwise under the direct supervision of a RO.

Do not bring more guests than you can safely supervise. The host BRC Member **must be present on the same
range** as any guest.

All guests must sign a waiver. Parents or guardians must execute a waiver for anyone under the age of 18.
Liability waivers are available on a clipboard inside the club house.

If the South Range is open to the public, all the shooters including BRC Members must be signed-in, execute a
waiver, and Member’s guests will pay the usual range fees. Members and Spouse members shall have their
membership card with them while on the range and have a waiver on file. On Public Days, BRC Members without a
current card must sign in, sign a waiver and pay usual non-member fees.

All guests must be made aware of the following Colorado statute:

> § 13-21-111.8. Assumption of risk - shooting ranges
>
> (1) Any person who engages in sport shooting activities at a qualifying sport shooting range, as defined
> under section 25-12-109 (2)(d), C.R.S., assumes the risk of injury or damage associated with sport shooting
> activities as set forth in section 13-21-111.7.
>
> (2) For purposes of this section, "engages in sport shooting activities" means entering and exiting a
> qualifying sport shooting range, preparing to shoot, waiting to shoot, shooting, or assisting another person
> in shooting at a qualifying sport shooting range. The term includes being a spectator at a qualifying sport
> shooting range and being present in the range for any reason.

### Member relations

Each member is entitled to only one space on the firing line. If other spaces are unoccupied, guests may use
them. If not, members and their guests must share range time/facilities. A member should not expect that all
their guests can be accommodated or allowed to shoot at the same time.

Any member who brings children, spouse, guests, or pets to the range shall be responsible for keeping them
behind the firing line and for their conduct and safety.

Pets should be kept under control or in a vehicle and any member bringing a pet shall be expected to clean up
after it if needed.

Be courteous and share usage with others present.

It is the responsibility of all shooters to protect the range facilities by placing targets only where
designated by the rules and never to allow shooting into target supports. It is also their responsibility to
ensure that no one litters the range by leaving behind paper targets or other items used for targets. Broken
clay targets may be left behind.

It is the responsibility of Members to maintain the condition of the ranges. If a target carrier (plywood) is
worn and unusable, remove it to the designated disposal area, and replace it from ready inventory.

It is the responsibility of Members to report to any Board member any BRC property damage or equipment
failure so the issue may be promptly addressed.

### Range closures and restrictions

Usage of a given range may be restricted for setup prior to its use for a scheduled match or class. If it is
to be restricted the day prior to a match, it should be after 4:00 PM.

The entire North or South Range shall be closed until 4:00 PM on scheduled work days or until special tasks
are completed.

All planned South Range matches or activities will be published in advance in the newsletter and on the
website calendar. Check the website for any updates.

### Range fees

All users of the **indoor range** must pay for use of the range which is $5 per shooter visit; match fees
include this payment.
Members' spouses may shoot free of charge on outdoor ranges (except in matches) when in the company of the
member.

Individuals under the age of 18 may shoot free of charge on outdoor ranges as long as they are using only **
one** range position and are supervised by an adult member or paying adult if the range is open to the
public. All guests must execute a waiver. Parents or guardians must execute a waiver for anyone under the age
of 18.

Range fees are included in all match fees. If a shooter has competed in a match on a day the range is open to
the public, range fees shall be considered to have been paid.

## Range rules for all ranges

### Hours of operation

Hours of operation for all outdoor ranges are 7:00 AM or sunrise (whichever is later) until dusk. Dusk at the
BRC is defined as **when the sun has set behind the foothills**.

Indoor Range hours are 24/7 if no scheduled activity is taking place.

### Basic safety

Eye and ear protection are required for both shooters and spectators at all times when on any BRC range.

No one is to climb on or shoot from the side or back (backstop) berms. Doing so will increase erosion and
damage the berms and possibly result in injury to those who do the climbing.

North is the only direction in which a firearm may be discharged on any outdoor range, with the exception of
the 50-foot pistol range (north of the 100-yard range) at the North Range.

All firearms on the firing line shall point down range at all times except when cased, holstered, slung, or
in the racks.

Firearms shall be handled on the firing line **only when no one is down range**, or in an area designated for
safe handling. **There shall be no loaded firearms handled behind the firing line**. During BRC matches and
events, BRC operates as a cold range. Participants in matches and events shall have firearms unloaded,
magazines removed, hammer down or striker released (uncocked), and firearms holstered or cased when not on
the firing line.

All firing shall be from a common firing line on each range. The normal firing lines on all ranges shall be
the northern edge of the concrete pads. The firing lines may be moved closer to the targets upon agreement of
the shooters present but may never be moved to the rear of the normal positions.

In order to avoid ricochets, no targets shall be placed on the floor of any ranges and no shooting shall be
allowed into the floor of any range.

Firing shall be from firing positions to corresponding targets only. No cross-range firing.

No shooting at steel targets is to take place closer than **eleven yards** directly in front of the targets.

All bullets must impact the backstops or a steel target.

## Firearm and ammunition restrictions

### Full-automatic

Owners of Class III firearms must adhere to all NFA rules and regulations for any firearm used at the Boulder
Rifle Club.

Full-Automatic firearms are only permitted at the South Range.

No automatic firearms shall be allowed when the range is open to the public. Full- automatic fire is not
permitted during public range days or matches.

### Other firearm restrictions

The use of rifles in caliber .50 BMG and/or those with a normal case capacity of 150 grains or more of powder
is prohibited.

Shotguns firing other than slugs are generally prohibited on all rifle or handgun ranges except when used
during an authorized match.

Shotguns firing pellets may be used for patterning or practice purposes on the 25 or 50-yard ranges when
proper facilities are in place but are not to be fired into wooden target backers. Use the patterning fixture
or bring your own target.

Additional firearm restrictions apply on some BRC Ranges. \[See Sections 4.1, 4.2\]

### Ammunition restrictions

The use of ammunition in caliber .50 BMG and/or those with a normal case capacity of 150 grains or more of
powder is prohibited.

No incendiary, tracer, or exploding ammunition is allowed on any BRC range.

Steel jacketed or steel core ammunition may not be used on the indoor range, the plate racks or other
metallic targets belonging to the club.

BRC restricts cartridges used on steel targets and Indoor Range. \[See Sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.7.\]

## Muddy conditions

muddy conditions.

# Approved targets and target placement

1. No exploding targets are to be used on any BRC range.
2. No bowling pins may be used as targets.
3. Outdoor targets shall be confined to paper, cardboard, soft plastic, clay, or metal cans (absolutely no glass or
   hard plastics). Metal cans (soda cans, soup cans, etc. Not steel containers or any other metal target which would
   pose a side-deflection hazard) and soft plastic containers are permitted but **must be removed** by the shooter
   before leaving the range. All disposable targets, excluding clay targets, shall be disposed of in the proper
   receptacles before leaving the range.
4. Indoor targets may be paper, soft plastic or cardboard only.
5. Firing at metal targets shall be permitted, so long as no rounds leave the range. All metallic targets must be
   placed directly in front of the backstops so that a miss will impact the backstop, **not the range floor**, or
   where facilities are set up for this activity. **Steel targets which present a side dispersion of bullet
   fragments, such as dueling trees, are not permitted**.
6. All non-paper targets shall be placed against the backstop. No targets are to be placed on the backstop above the
   height of the target carriers, with the exception of clay pigeon targets which does not involve climbing on the
   backstop. No targets are to be placed on or near the top of the backstop.
7. All paper targets shall be placed in the center of the target boards. No targets are to be placed on the 2x4
   target frames.
8. Steel targets with designated distances or designated uses are not to be used for other distances or purposes.

9. Any personally-owned steel target that can present a rearward, sideward (**for example, dueling trees**) or angle
   deflection towards the shooter, or at an angle that would send a projectile off the range, is prohibited.
10. No double taps are allowed on rearward falling metal targets.
11. No shooting of steel targets is to take place closer than 11 yards from the target.
12. No targets shall be placed on the floor of any BRC ranges and no shooting shall be allowed into the floor of any

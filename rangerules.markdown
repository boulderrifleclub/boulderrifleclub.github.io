1. Introduction

    1. Purpose

       As a Member-owned and Member-operated club, it is vital that all members have a complete knowledge and
       understanding of the Boulder Rifle Club Range Rules. The purpose of this manual is to inform members of the Range
       Rules, and to act as a reference for members and range officers when they are confronted with a new or different
       situation on any of our ranges.

    2. Safety and the range rules

       **The most important duty of any member is to keep the range safe**. The member does this by knowing, following,
       and helping to enforce the Boulder Rifle Club range rules. If you are uncertain whether an activity or situation
       complies with the Range Rules, ask any Board member for clarification. Please err on the side of caution and
       safety.

    3. Exceptions to the range rules

       The following Range Rules are in effect at all times, on all Boulder Rifle Club ranges for all users. Any
       exceptions to the range rules must be explained and justified in advance and approved by the Board of Directors.

       Violators of the rules may be required to appear before the Board of Directors.
       Suspension of range privileges or loss of membership may occur if any of the following rules are violated by a
       member or their guests. Members who have been suspended must attend a range rules class before being reinstated.

2. General range rules

    1. Member responsibilities

        1. Protect our club

           Members shall have a current, valid membership card on their person and have a liability release form on file
           when on any BRC property.

           Do not share a numbered key or reveal any BRC lock combination with any non-member.

           Lock the gate behind you. At the South Range during scheduled activities involving non-members, the gate
           shall be left in the condition in which you found it; during events, the gate may be closed with the chain
           attached with a marinerâ€™s clip, with the padlock secured to the eye-bolt on the gate post.

           **Always** lock the North Range gate after entering and upon leaving.

           Only BRC Members who have attended a Range Rules Class and possess a current BRC Membership card shall open
           any BRC locks.

           No individuals under the influence of alcohol, medications or other substances which impair vision, balance,
           or judgment are allowed on the range. Nor are such items to be consumed on the property. Possession of drugs,
           including alcohol, is not allowed on BRC property. This is in addition to prohibitions of use or being under
           the influence of any impairing substance.

           Every individual present on the range is responsible for safety. If a Range Officer is present, the RO has
           the final authority and control over all activities on the range.

           It is the duty of any member to ask anyone who acts in an unsafe manner to cease their unsafe actions and/or
           leave the range.

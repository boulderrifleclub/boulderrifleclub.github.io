1. Introduction

    1. Purpose

       As a Member-owned and Member-operated club, it is vital that all members have a complete knowledge and
       understanding of the Boulder Rifle Club Range Rules. The purpose of this manual is to inform members of the Range
       Rules, and to act as a reference for members and range officers when they are confronted with a new or different
       situation on any of our ranges.

    2. Safety and the range rules

       **The most important duty of any member is to keep the range safe**. The member does this by knowing, following,
       and helping to enforce the Boulder Rifle Club range rules. If you are uncertain whether an activity or situation
       complies with the Range Rules, ask any Board member for clarification. Please err on the side of caution and
       safety.

    3. Exceptions to the range rules

       The following Range Rules are in effect at all times, on all Boulder Rifle Club ranges for all users. Any
       exceptions to the range rules must be explained and justified in advance and approved by the Board of Directors.

       Violators of the rules may be required to appear before the Board of Directors.
       Suspension of range privileges or loss of membership may occur if any of the following rules are violated by a
       member or their guests. Members who have been suspended must attend a range rules class before being reinstated.

2. General range rules

    1. Member responsibilities

        1. Protect our club

           Members shall have a current, valid membership card on their person and have a liability release form on file
           when on any BRC property.

           Do not share a numbered key or reveal any BRC lock combination with any non-member.

           Lock the gate behind you. At the South Range during scheduled activities involving non-members, the gate
           shall be left in the condition in which you found it; during events, the gate may be closed with the chain
           attached with a mariner’s clip, with the padlock secured to the eye-bolt on the gate post.

           **Always** lock the North Range gate after entering and upon leaving.

           Only BRC Members who have attended a Range Rules Class and possess a current BRC Membership card shall open
           any BRC locks.

           No individuals under the influence of alcohol, medications or other substances which impair vision, balance,
           or judgment are allowed on the range. Nor are such items to be consumed on the property. Possession of drugs,
           including alcohol, is not allowed on BRC property. This is in addition to prohibitions of use or being under
           the influence of any impairing substance.

           Every individual present on the range is responsible for safety. If a Range Officer is present, the RO has
           the final authority and control over all activities on the range.

           It is the duty of any member to ask anyone who acts in an unsafe manner to cease their unsafe actions and/or
           leave the range.

        2. Guest policies

           The ranges are open to non-members only when accompanied by a BRC Member or under the control of a Range
           Officer (RO) on that range.

           Members have the right to bring guests when the range is not open to the public. During times when the South
           Range is open to the public, guests must pay the range fee.

           Guests must be under the host BRC Member’s **direct** supervision **at all times** if the range is closed to
           the public, otherwise under the direct supervision of a RO.

           Do not bring more guests than you can safely supervise. The host BRC Member **must be present on the same
           range** as any guest.

           All guests must sign a waiver. Parents or guardians must execute a waiver for anyone under the age of 18.
           Liability waivers are available on a clipboard inside the club house.

           If the South Range is open to the public, all the shooters including BRC Members must be signed-in, execute a
           waiver, and Member’s guests will pay the usual range fees. Members and Spouse members shall have their
           membership card with them while on the range and have a waiver on file. On Public Days, BRC Members without a
           current card must sign in, sign a waiver and pay usual non-member fees.

           All guests must be made aware of the following Colorado statute:

           > § 13-21-111.8. Assumption of risk - shooting ranges
           > (1) Any person who engages in sport shooting activities at a qualifying sport shooting range, as defined
           under section 25-12-109 (2)(d), C.R.S., assumes the risk of injury or damage associated with sport shooting
           activities as set forth in section 13-21-111.7.
           > (2) For purposes of this section, "engages in sport shooting activities" means entering and exiting a
           qualifying sport shooting range, preparing to shoot, waiting to shoot, shooting, or assisting another person
           in shooting at a qualifying sport shooting range. The term includes being a spectator at a qualifying sport
           shooting range and being present in the range for any reason.

        3. Member relations

           Each member is entitled to only one space on the firing line. If other spaces are unoccupied, guests may use
           them. If not, members and their guests must share range time/facilities. A member should not expect that all
           their guests can be accommodated or allowed to shoot at the same time.

           Any member who brings children, spouse, guests, or pets to the range shall be responsible for keeping them
           behind the firing line and for their conduct and safety.

           Pets should be kept under control or in a vehicle and any member bringing a pet shall be expected to clean up
           after it if needed.

           Be courteous and share usage with others present.

           It is the responsibility of all shooters to protect the range facilities by placing targets only where
           designated by the rules and never to allow shooting into target supports. It is also their responsibility to
           ensure that no one litters the range by leaving behind paper targets or other items used for targets. Broken
           clay targets may be left behind.

           It is the responsibility of Members to maintain the condition of the ranges. If a target carrier (plywood) is
           worn and unusable, remove it to the designated disposal area, and replace it from ready inventory.

           It is the responsibility of Members to report to any Board member any BRC property damage or equipment
           failure so the issue may be promptly addressed.

        4. Range closures and restrictions

           Usage of a given range may be restricted for setup prior to its use for a scheduled match or class. If it is
           to be restricted the day prior to a match, it should be after 4:00 PM.

           The entire North or South Range shall be closed until 4:00 PM on scheduled work days or until special tasks
           are completed.
           
           All planned South Range matches or activities will be published in advance in the newsletter and on the
           website calendar. Check the website for any updates.
